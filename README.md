# Description
A python application which creates and solves mazes. 
It uses Tk GUI toolkit(via Tkinter binding) for maze visualizations.

Run Instructions: 
```
python main.py
```

## Extension ideas:
- Add other solving algorithms, like breadth first search or A*
- Make the visuals prettier, change the colors, etc
- Mess with the animation settings to make it faster/slower. Maybe make backtracking slow and blazing new paths faster?
- Add configurations in the app itself using Tkinter buttons and inputs to allow users to change maze size, speed, etc
- Make it a game 
    - allow the user to choose directions
    - allow the user to race an algorithm
- Make it 3 dimensional
- Time the various algorithms, see which ones are fastest
